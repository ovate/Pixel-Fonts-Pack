# Pixel-Fonts-Pack
The zip includes 10 bitmap (pixel) fonts (.ttf) that I picked out at pentacom. Also a .txt file called "permalinks" as reference of where the fonts originated from.

Gallery source- http://www.pentacom.jp/pentacom/bitfontmaker2/gallery/

Note: From the gallery's website, some fonts have a certain license. Please check before downloading.
